# Safe Contact


## About Safe Contact

## Principle
 
This application aims to receive data from meetings between users. These users are unique thanks to a randomly generated uuid and a hash of its device id. It is therefore impossible to find and identify the person.

These users will be able to declare themselves to be sick anonymously in order to notify the people they have met.

## Legal Informations

#### RGPD Complient

We don't record any personal data . So this application is **RGPD complient**. 

## Technical Informations

This application uses the Laravel 7 framework (php).

For technical reasons we have chosen to use a PostgreSQL database but you can use any relational database
